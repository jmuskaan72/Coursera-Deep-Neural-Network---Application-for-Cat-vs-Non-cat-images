# Coursera-Deep-Neural-Network---Application-for-Cat-vs-Non-cat-images
 Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves to image classfication.

While using the logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy. Your algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! By completing this exercise, you will:

- Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.

- Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.

- Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
