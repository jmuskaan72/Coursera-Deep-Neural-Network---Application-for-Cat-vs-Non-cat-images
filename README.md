While using the logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 68% accuracy.But now, this algorithm will now give you an 80% accuracy! By completing this exercise, I have:

- Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous LR model of any structure I want.

- Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.

- Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
