## Dataset description

You will use the same "Cat vs non-Cat" dataset as in "Logistic Regression as a Neural Network". 
The model you had built had 70% test accuracy on classifying cats vs non-cats images.

Problem Statement: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:

- a training set of m_train images labelled as cat (1) or non-cat (0)
- a test set of m_test images labelled as cat and non-cat
- each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB).

*h5py* is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
